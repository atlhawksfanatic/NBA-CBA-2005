# EXPANSION

The NBA may determine during the term of this Agreement to expand the number of Teams and to have existing Teams make available for assignment to any such Expansion Teams the Player Contracts of a certain number of Veterans under substantially the same terms and in substantially the same manner that Player Contracts were made available to the Charlotte expansion Team pursuant to the 1999 NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining Agreement; provided, however, that any change shall be subject to the approval of the Players Association, which shall not be unreasonably withheld.
