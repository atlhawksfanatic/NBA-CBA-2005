On such twenty-ninth day, Veterans may only be required to attend a Team dinner and Team meetings, participate in photograph and media sessions, and submit to a physical examination.
(b) Notwithstanding Section 1(a) above, if a Veteran Player is under contract to a Team that is scheduled during a particular NBA Season to participate outside North America in an Exhibition game or a Regular Season game during the first ten (10) days of the Regular Season, such Veteran Player may be required to attend the training camp conducted in advance of that Regular Season by 11 a.m. (local time) on the thirty-second day prior to the first game of the Regular Season.
(c) Rookies may be required to attend training camp on a date earlier than the date(s) specified in Sections 1(a) and 1(b) above, but no earlier than ten (10) days prior to the date that Veterans on such Team are required to attend.

    (ii) The NBA shall be required to notify the Players Association of its intention to conduct a team training camp outside the United States and Canada. Within three (3) business days of its receipt of such notification, the Players Association shall have the right to disapprove such plans, provided that such disapproval may be based solely on a reasonable and well-founded concern that the location of such training camp would be unsafe for players.
    (iii) No Team shall hold its training camp outside the United States and Canada in any two successive Seasons.
    (iv) Players on a Team that holds its training camp outside of the United States and Canada shall have at least one day off following the travel day during which they travel back to the United States from such training camp.
(e) (i) During the first six days of training camp: (A) a Team shall be permitted to conduct no more than two (2) regular practice sessions per day; (B) such session(s) may last an aggregate of no longer than 3.5 hours (excluding time – not to exceed 30 minutes – spent stretching and participating in aerobic warm-ups and cool-downs); and (C) if a Team elects to conduct two (2) regular practice sessions during a day, one of the two sessions must be limited to non-contact activities. For the remainder of training camp, a Team shall be permitted to conduct no more than one (1) regular practice session per day and such session may last no longer than 3.5 hours (excluding time – not to exceed 30 minutes – spent stretching and participating in aerobic warm-ups and cool downs).
    (ii) If a Team conducts one or two regular practice sessions during a day in accordance with Section 1(e)(i) above, then except as provided in clause (A) of Section 1(e)(iii) below, the Team shall not, at a separate time during the day, conduct, organize or supervise any additional basketball activity on the basketball court.
    (iii) Nothing in Section 1(e)(i) and (ii) above shall be construed to prohibit a Team, on any day of training camp, from conducting one or two regular practice sessions in accordance with Section 1(e)(i) above, plus:
        (A) on-court skills development sessions (e.g., pick-and-roll situations, shooting, passing, etc.) not involving the playing of live defense (i.e., only "dummy" defense may be played) and not involving the practicing of four-man or five-man offenses or defenses; and
        (B) team-related or training-related activities (including, but not limited to, weight training, other conditioning sessions (excluding high-impact conditioning drills that are normally conducted during regular practice sessions), video sessions, meetings, and promotional appearances), so long as such additional activities do not include any basketball activity on the basketball court that is organized, supervised, or conducted by the Team.

## Exhibition Games.

(a) Exhibition games prior to any Regular Season shall not exceed eight (8) (including intra-squad games for which admission is charged), and Exhibition games during any Regular Season shall not exceed three (3).

(c) Teams at home on December 25 and January 1 (each, a "Holiday") may, but shall not be required to, conduct a practice on either (or both) of such Holidays, provided: (i) the Team's players have requested that they practice on the Holiday, as communicated to the Team by the Team's player representative; and (ii) within seven (7) days before or after the Holiday, the Team's players are provided with a "day off" — i.e., the Team will not conduct any practice, including any optional practice, on such date, and the Team will not have a scheduled game on such date.
