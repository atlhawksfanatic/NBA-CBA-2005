         During the term of this Agreement, the Players Association agrees that the NBA,

         The Players Association, for itself and present and future NBA players, covenants not to
sue (or finance any suit against) the NBA, Properties, Media Ventures, and any NBA Team, or,
any of their respective past, present and future owners (direct and indirect) acting in their
capacity as owners of any of the foregoing entities, officers, directors, trustees, employees,
agents, attorneys, licensees, successors, heirs, administrators, executors and assigns, with respect
to the use, distribution, or license, for any form of broadcast or telecast, including over-the-air

of cassette, cartridge, or disk system, or other means of distribution known or unknown, of any
performances by any player rendered under this Agreement or prior collective bargaining
agreements, or under Player Contracts made pursuant thereto, during any period up to and
including the day following the last Playoff game of the 2010-11 NBA Season (or, if the NBAexercises its option to extend this Agreement, up to and including the day following the last
Playoff game of the 2011-12 NBA Season).
Section 3.     Reservation of Rights.
       The Players Association expressly reserves its rights to bargain collectively on the subject

however, preclude the NBA from contending that the subject described in Section 1 above is not
a mandatory subject of collective bargaining.
