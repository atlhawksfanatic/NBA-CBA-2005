                           UNIFORM PLAYER CONTRACT
         THIS AGREEMENT made this _____ day of___________________, is by and between
________________________ (hereinafter called the "Team"), a member of the National
Basketball Association (hereinafter called the "NBA" or "League") and ___________________ ,
an individual whose address is shown below (hereinafter called the "Player"). In consideration
of the mutual promises hereinafter contained, the parties hereto promise and agree as follows:
         1.      TERM.
         The Team hereby employs the Player as a skilled basketball player for a term of ____
year(s) from the 1st day of September ____.
         2.      SERVICES.
         The services to be rendered by the Player pursuant to this Contract shall include:
(a) training camp, (b) practices, meetings, workouts, and skill or conditioning sessions conducted
by the Team during the Season, (c) games scheduled for the Team during any Regular Season,
(d) Exhibition games scheduled by the Team or the League during and prior to any Regular
Season, (e) if the Player is invited to participate, the NBA's All-Star Game (including the
Rookie-Sophomore Game) and every event conducted in association with such All-Star Game,
but only in accordance with Article XXI of the Collective Bargaining Agreement currently in
effect between the NBA and the National Basketball Players Association (hereinafter the
"CBA"), (f) Playoff games scheduled by the League subsequent to any Regular Season,
(g) promotional and commercial activities of the Team and the League as set forth in this
Contract and the CBA, and (h) any NBADL Work Assignment in accordance with Article XLII
of the CBA.
         3.      COMPENSATION.
         (a)     Subject to paragraph 3(b) below, the Team agrees to pay the Player for rendering
the services and performing the obligations described herein the Compensation described in
Exhibit 1 or Exhibit 1A hereto (less all amounts required to be withheld by any governmental
authority, and exclusive of any amount(s) which the Player shall be entitled to receive from the
Player Playoff Pool). Unless otherwise provided in Exhibit 1, such Compensation shall be paid
in twelve (12) equal semi-monthly payments beginning with the first of said payments on
November 15th of each year covered by the Contract and continuing with such payments on the
first and fifteenth of each month until said Compensation is paid in full.
         (b)     The Team agrees to pay the Player \$1,500 per week, pro rata, less all amounts
required to be withheld by any governmental authority, for each week (up to a maximum of
                                                A-four (4) weeks for Veterans and up to a maximum of five (5) weeks for Rookies) prior to the
Team's first Regular Season game that the Player is in attendance at training camp or Exhibition
games; provided, however, that no such payments shall be made if, prior to the date on which he
is required to attend training camp, the Player has been paid \$10,000 or more in Compensation
with respect to the NBA Season scheduled to commence immediately following such training
camp. Any Compensation paid by the Team pursuant to this subparagraph shall be considered
an advance against any Compensation owed to the Player pursuant to paragraph 3(a) above, and
the first scheduled payment of such Compensation (or such subsequent payments, if the first
scheduled payment is not sufficient) shall be reduced by the amount of such advance.
        (c)      The Team will not pay and the Player will not accept any bonus or anything of
value on account of the Team's winning any particular NBA game or series of games or attaining
a certain position in the standings of the League as of a certain date, other than the final standing
of the Team.
        4.       EXPENSES.
        The Team agrees to pay all proper and necessary expenses of the Player, including the
reasonable lodging expenses of the Player while playing for the Team "on the road" and during
the training camp period (defined for this paragraph only to mean the period from the first day of
training camp through the day of the Team's first Exhibition game) for as long as the Player is
not then living at home. The Player, while "on the road" (and during the training camp period,
only if the Player is not then living at home and the Team does not pay for meals directly), shall
be paid a meal expense allowance as set forth in the CBA. No deductions from such meal
expense allowance shall be made for meals served on an airplane. During the training camp
period (and only if the Player is not then living at home and the Team does not pay for meals
directly), the meal expense allowance shall be paid in weekly installments commencing with the
first week of training camp. For the purposes of this paragraph, the Player shall be considered to
be "on the road" from the time the Team leaves its home city until the time the Team arrives
back at its home city.
        5.       CONDUCT.
        (a)      The Player agrees to observe and comply with all Team rules, as maintained or
promulgated in accordance with the CBA, at all times whether on or off the playing floor.
Subject to the provisions of the CBA, such rules shall be part of this Contract as fully as if herein
written and shall be binding upon the Player.
        (b)      The Player agrees: (i) to give his best services, as well as his loyalty, to the Team,
and to play basketball only for the Team and its assignees; (ii) to be neatly and fully attired in
public; (iii) to conduct himself on and off the court according to the highest standards of honesty,
citizenship, and sportsmanship; and (iv) not to do anything that is materially detrimental or
materially prejudicial to the best interests of the Team or the League.
        (c)      For any violation of Team rules, any breach of any provision of this Contract, or
for any conduct impairing the faithful and thorough discharge of the duties incumbent upon the
                                                  A-Player, the Team may reasonably impose fines and/or suspensions on the Player in accordance
with the terms of the CBA.
        (d)     The Player agrees to be bound by Article 35 of the NBA Constitution, a copy of
which, as in effect on the date of this Contract, is attached hereto. The Player acknowledges that
the Commissioner is empowered to impose fines upon and/or suspend the Player for causes and
in the manner provided in such Article, provided that such fines and/or suspensions are
consistent with the terms of the CBA.
        (e)     The Player agrees that if the Commissioner, in his sole judgment, shall find that
the Player has bet, or has offered or attempted to bet, money or anything of value on the outcome
of any game participated in by any team which is a member of the NBA, the Commissioner shall
have the power in his sole discretion to suspend the Player indefinitely or to expel him as a
player for any member of the NBA, and the Commissioner's finding and decision shall be final,
binding, conclusive, and unappealable.
        (f)     The Player agrees that he will not, during the term of this Contract, directly or
indirectly, entice, induce, or persuade, or attempt to entice, induce, or persuade, any player or
coach who is under contract to any NBA team to enter into negotiations for or relating to his
services as a basketball player or coach, nor shall he negotiate for or contract for such services,
except with the prior written consent of such team. Breach of this subparagraph, in addition to
the remedies available to the Team, shall be punishable by fine and/or suspension to be imposed
by the Commissioner.
        (g)     When the Player is fined and/or suspended by the Team or the NBA, he shall be
given notice in writing (with a copy to the Players Association), stating the amount of the fine or
the duration of the suspension and the reasons therefor.
        6.      WITHHOLDING.
        (a)     In the event the Player is fined and/or suspended by the Team or the NBA, the
Team shall withhold the amount of the fine or, in the case of a suspension, the amount provided
in Article VI of the CBA from any Current Base Compensation due or to become due to the
Player with respect to the contract year in which the conduct resulting in the fine and/or the
suspension occurred (or a subsequent contract year if the Player has received all Current Base
Compensation due to him for the then current contract year). If, at the time the Player is fined
and/or suspended, the Current Base Compensation remaining to be paid to the Player under this
Contract is not sufficient to cover such fine and/or suspension, then the Player agrees promptly to
pay the amount directly to the Team. In no case shall the Player permit any such fine and/or
suspension to be paid on his behalf by anyone other than himself.
        (b)     Any Current Base Compensation withheld from or paid by the Player pursuant to
this paragraph 6 shall be retained by the Team or the League, as the case may be, unless the
Player contests the fine and/or suspension by initiating a timely Grievance in accordance with the
provisions of the CBA. If such Grievance is initiated and it satisfies Article XXXI, Section 13 of
the CBA, the amount withheld from the Player shall be placed in an interest-bearing account,
pursuant to Article XXXI, Section 9 of such Agreement, pending the resolution of the Grievance.
                                                A-7.      PHYSICAL CONDITION.
        (a)     The Player agrees to report at the time and place fixed by the Team in good
physical condition and to keep himself throughout each NBA Season in good physical condition.
        (b)     If the Player, in the judgment of the Team's physician, is not in good physical
condition at the date of his first scheduled game for the Team, or if, at the beginning of or during
any Season, he fails to remain in good physical condition (unless such condition results directly
from an injury sustained by the Player as a direct result of participating in any basketball practice
or game played for the Team during such Season), so as to render the Player, in the judgment of
the Team's physician, unfit to play skilled basketball, the Team shall have the right to suspend
such Player until such time as, in the judgment of the Team's physician, the Player is in
sufficiently good physical condition to play skilled basketball. In the event of such suspension,
the Base Compensation payable to the Player for any Season during such suspension shall be
reduced in the same proportion as the length of the period during which, in the judgment of the
Team's physician, the Player is unfit to play skilled basketball, bears to the length of such
Season. Nothing in this subparagraph shall authorize the Team to suspend the Player solely
because the Player is injured or ill.
        (c)     If, during the term of this Contract, the Player is injured as a direct result of
participating in any basketball practice or game played for the Team, the Team will pay the
Player's reasonable hospitalization and medical expenses (including doctor's bills), provided that
the hospital and doctor are selected by the Team, and provided further that the Team shall be
obligated to pay only those expenses incurred as a direct result of medical treatment caused
solely by and relating directly to the injury sustained by the Player. Subject to the provisions set
forth in Exhibit 3, if in the judgment of the Team's physician, the Player's injuries resulted
directly from playing for the Team and render him unfit to play skilled basketball, then, so long
as such unfitness continues, but in no event after the Player has received his full Base
Compensation for the Season in which the injury was sustained, the Team shall pay to the Player
the Base Compensation prescribed in Exhibit 1 to this Contract for such Season. The Team's
obligations hereunder shall be reduced by (i) any workers' compensation benefits, which, to the
extent permitted by law, the Player hereby assigns to the Team, and (ii) any insurance provided
for by the Team whether paid or payable to the Player.
        (d)     The Player agrees to provide to the Team's coach, trainer, or physician prompt
notice of any injury, illness, or medical condition suffered by him that is likely to affect
adversely the Player's ability to render the services required under this Contract, including the
time, place, cause, and nature of such injury, illness, or condition.
        (e)     Should the Player suffer an injury, illness, or medical condition, he will submit
himself to a medical examination, appropriate medical treatment by a physician designated by
the Team, and such rehabilitation activities as such physician may specify. Such examination
when made at the request of the Team shall be at its expense, unless made necessary by some act
or conduct of the Player contrary to the terms of this Contract.
        (f)     The Player agrees (i) to submit to a physical examination at the commencement
and conclusion of each Contract year hereunder, and at such other times as reasonably
                                                 A-determined by the Team to be medically necessary, and (ii) at the commencement of this
Contract, and upon the request of the Team, to provide a complete prior medical history.
        (g)     The Player agrees to supply complete and truthful information in connection with
any medical examinations or requests for medical information authorized by this Contract.
        (h)     A Player who consults a physician other than a physician designated by the Team
shall give notice of such consultation to the Team and shall authorize and direct such other
physician to provide the Team with all information it may request concerning any condition that
in the judgment of the Team's physician may affect the Player's ability to play skilled basketball.
        (i)     If and to the extent necessary to enable or facilitate the disclosure of medical
information as provided for by this Contract or Article XXII of the CBA, the Player shall execute
such individual authorization(s) as may be requested by the Team or as may be required by
health care providers who examine or treat the Player.
        8.      PROHIBITED SUBSTANCES.
        The Player acknowledges that this Contract may be terminated in accordance with the
express provisions of Article XXXIII (Anti-Drug Program) of the CBA, and that any such
termination will result in the Player's immediate dismissal and disqualification from any
employment by the NBA and any of its teams. Notwithstanding any terms or provisions of this
Contract (including any amendments hereto), in the event of such termination, all obligations of
the Team, including obligations to pay Compensation, shall cease, except the obligation of the
Team to pay the Player's earned Compensation (whether Current or Deferred) to the date of
termination.
        9.      UNIQUE SKILLS.
        The Player represents and agrees that he has extraordinary and unique skill and ability as
a basketball player, that the services to be rendered by him hereunder cannot be replaced or the
loss thereof adequately compensated for in money damages, and that any breach by the Player of
this Contract will cause irreparable injury to the Team, and to its assignees. Therefore, it is
agreed that in the event it is alleged by the Team that the Player is playing, attempting or
threatening to play, or negotiating for the purpose of playing, during the term of this Contract,
for any other person, firm, entity, or organization, the Team and its assignees (in addition to any
other remedies that may be available to them judicially or by way of arbitration) shall have the
right to obtain from any court or arbitrator having jurisdiction such equitable relief as may be
appropriate, including a decree enjoining the Player from any further such breach of this
Contract, and enjoining the Player from playing basketball for any other person, firm, entity, or
organization during the term of this Contract. The Player agrees that this right may be enforced
by the Team or the NBA. In any suit, action, or arbitration proceeding brought to obtain such
equitable relief, the Player does hereby waive his right, if any, to trial by jury, and does hereby
waive his right, if any, to interpose any counterclaim or set-off for any cause whatever.
                                                A-10.     ASSIGNMENT.
        (a)     The Team shall have the right to assign this Contract to any other NBA team and
the Player agrees to accept such assignment and to faithfully perform and carry out this Contract
with the same force and effect as if it had been entered into by the Player with the assignee team
instead of with the Team.
        (b)     In the event that this Contract is assigned to any other NBA team, all reasonable
expenses incurred by the Player in moving himself and his family to the home territory of the
team to which such assignment is made, as a result thereof, shall be paid by the assignee team.
        (c)     In the event that this Contract is assigned to another NBA team, the Player shall
forthwith be provided notice orally or in writing, delivered to the Player personally or delivered
or mailed to his last known address, and the Player shall report to the assignee team within forty-
eight (48) hours after said notice has been received (if the assignment is made during a Season),
within one (1) week after said notice has been received (if the assignment is made between
Seasons), or within such longer time for reporting as may be specified in said notice. The NBA
shall also promptly notify the Players Association of any such assignment. The Player further
agrees that, immediately upon reporting to the assignee team, he will submit upon request to a
physical examination conducted by a physician designated by the assignee team.
        (d)     If the Player, without a reasonable excuse, does not report to the team to which
this Contract has been assigned within the time provided in subsection (c) above, then (i) upon
consummation of the assignment, the Player may be disciplined by the assignee team or, if the
assignment is not consummated or is voided as a result of the Player's failure to so report, by the
assignor Team, and (ii) such conduct shall constitute conduct prejudicial to the NBA under
Article 35(d) of the NBA Constitution, and shall therefore subject the Player to discipline from
the NBA in accordance with such Article.
        11.     VALIDITY AND FILING.
        (a)     This Contract shall be valid and binding upon the Team and the Player
immediately upon its execution.
        (b)     The Team agrees to file a copy of this Contract, and/or any amendment(s) thereto,
with the Commissioner of the NBA as soon as practicable by facsimile and overnight mail, but in
no event may such filing be made more than forty-eight (48) hours after the execution of this
Contract and/or amendment(s).
        (c)     If pursuant to the NBA Constitution and By-Laws or the CBA, the Commissioner
disapproves this Contract (or amendment) within ten (10) days after the receipt thereof in his
office by overnight mail, this Contract (or amendment) shall thereupon terminate and be of no
further force or effect and the Team and the Player shall thereupon be relieved of their respective
rights and liabilities thereunder. If the Commissioner's disapproval is subsequently overturned
in any proceeding brought under the arbitration provisions of the CBA (including any appeals),
the Contract shall again be valid and binding upon the Team and the Player, and the
Commissioner shall be afforded another ten-day period to disapprove the Contract (based on the
Team's Room at the time the Commissioner's disapproval is overturned) as set forth in the
                                                 A-foregoing sentence. The NBA will promptly inform the Players Association if the Commissioner
disapproves this Contract.
        12.      PROHIBITED ACTIVITIES.
        The Player and the Team acknowledge and agree that the Player's participation in certain
other activities may impair or destroy his ability and skill as a basketball player, and the Player's
participation in any game or exhibition of basketball other than at the request of the Team may
result in injury to him. Accordingly, the Player agrees that he will not, without the written
consent of the Team, engage in any activity that a reasonable person would recognize as
involving or exposing the participant to a substantial risk of bodily injury including, but not
limited to: (i) sky-diving, hang gliding, snow skiing, rock or mountain climbing (as distinguished
from hiking), rappelling, and bungee jumping; (ii) any fighting, boxing, or wrestling; (iii) driving
or riding on a motorcycle or moped; (iv) riding in or on any motorized vehicle in any kind of
race or racing contest; (v) operating an aircraft of any kind; (vi) engaging in any other activity
excluded or prohibited by or under any insurance policy which the Team procures against the
injury, illness or disability to or of the Player, or death of the Player, for which the Player has
received written notice from the Team prior to the execution of this Contract; or (vii)
participating in any game or exhibition of basketball, football, baseball, hockey, lacrosse, or
other team sport or competition. If the Player violates this Paragraph 12, he shall be subject to
discipline imposed by the Team and/or the Commissioner of the NBA. Nothing contained herein
shall be intended to require the Player to obtain the written consent of the Team in order to
enable the Player to participate in, as an amateur, the sports of golf, tennis, handball, swimming,
hiking, softball, volleyball, and other similar sports that a reasonable person would not recognize
as involving or exposing the participant to a substantial risk of bodily injury.
        13.      PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES.
        (a)      The Player agrees to allow the Team, the NBA, or a League-related entity to take
pictures of the Player, alone or together with others, for still photographs, motion pictures, or
television, at such reasonable times as the Team, the NBA or the League-related entity may
designate. No matter by whom taken, such pictures may be used in any manner desired by either
the Team, the NBA, or the League-related entity for publicity or promotional purposes. The
rights in any such pictures taken by the Team, the NBA, or the League-related entity shall belong
to the Team, the NBA, or the League-related entity, as their interests may appear.
        (b)      The Player agrees that, during any year of this Contract, he will not make public
appearances, participate in radio or television programs, permit his picture to be taken, write or
sponsor newspaper or magazine articles, or sponsor commercial products without the written
consent of the Team, which shall not be withheld except in the reasonable interests of the Team
or the NBA. The foregoing shall be interpreted in accordance with the decision in Portland Trail
Blazers v. Darnell Valentine and Jim Paxson, Decision 86-2 (August 13, 1986).
        (c)      Upon request, the Player shall consent to and make himself available for
interviews by representatives of the media conducted at reasonable times.
                                                 A-(d)     In addition to the foregoing, and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth
in Article II, Section 8 of the CBA, the Player agrees to participate, upon request, in all other
reasonable promotional activities of the Team, the NBA, and any League-related entity. For
each such promotional appearance made on behalf of a commercial sponsor of the Team, the
Team agrees to pay the Player \$2,500 or, if the Team agrees, such higher amount that is
consistent with the Team's past practice and not otherwise unreasonable.
        14.     GROUP LICENSE.
        (a)     The Player hereby grants to NBA Properties, Inc. (and its related entities) the
exclusive rights to use the Player's Player Attributes as such term is defined and for such group
licensing purposes as are set forth in the Agreement between NBA Properties, Inc. and the
National Basketball Players Association, made as of September 18, 1995 and amended January
20, 1999 and July 29, 2005 (the "Group License"), a copy of which will, upon his request, be
furnished to the Player; and the Player agrees to make the appearances called for by such
Agreement.
        (b)     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Group License or this
Contract, NBA Properties (and its related entities) may use, in connection with League
Promotions, the Player's (i) name or nickname and/or (ii) the Player's Player Attributes (as
defined in the Group License) as such Player Attributes may be captured in game action footage
or photographs. NBA Properties (and its related entities) shall be entitled to use the Player's
Player Attributes individually pursuant to the preceding sentence and shall not be required to use
the Player's Player Attributes in a group or as one of multiple players. As used herein, League
Promotion shall mean any advertising, marketing, or collateral materials or marketing programs
conducted by the NBA, NBA Properties (and its related entities) or any NBA team that is
intended to promote (A) any game in which an NBA team participates or game telecast,
cablecast or broadcast (including Pre-Season, Exhibition, Regular Season, and Playoff games),
(B) the NBA, its teams, or its players, or (C) the sport of basketball.
        15.     TEAM DEFAULT.
        In the event of an alleged default by the Team in the payments to the Player provided for
by this Contract, or in the event of an alleged failure by the Team to perform any other material
obligation that it has agreed to perform hereunder, the Player shall notify both the Team and the
League in writing of the facts constituting such alleged default or alleged failure. If neither the
Team nor the League shall cause such alleged default or alleged failure to be remedied within
five (5) days after receipt of such written notice, the National Basketball Players Association
shall, on behalf of the Player, have the right to request that the dispute concerning such alleged
default or alleged failure be referred immediately to the Grievance Arbitrator in accordance with
the provisions of the CBA. If, as a result of such arbitration, an award issues in favor of the
Player, and if neither the Team nor the League complies with such award within ten (10) days
after the service thereof, the Player shall have the right, by a further written notice to the Team
and the League, to terminate this Contract.
                                                 A-16.    TERMINATION.
        (a)    The Team may terminate this Contract upon written notice to the Player if the
Player shall:
               (i)      at any time, fail, refuse, or neglect to conform his personal conduct to
               standards of good citizenship, good moral character (defined here to mean not
               engaging in acts of moral turpitude, whether or not such acts would constitute a
               crime), and good sportsmanship, to keep himself in first class physical condition,
               or to obey the Team's training rules;
               (ii)     at any time commit a significant and inexcusable physical attack against
               any official or employee of the Team or the NBA (other than another player), or
               any person in attendance at any NBA game or event, considering the totality of
               the circumstances, including (but not limited to) the degree of provocation (if any)
               that may have led to the attack, the nature and scope of the attack, the Player's
               state of mind at the time of the attack, and the extent of any injury resulting from
               the attack;
               (iii) at any time, fail, in the sole opinion of the Team's management, to exhibit
               sufficient skill or competitive ability to qualify to continue as a member of the
               Team; provided, however, (A) that if this Contract is terminated by the Team, in
               accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph, prior to January 10 of any
               Season, and the Player, at the time of such termination, is unfit to play skilled
               basketball as the result of an injury resulting directly from his playing for the
               Team, the Player shall (subject to the provisions set forth in Exhibit 3) continue to
               receive his full Base Compensation, less all workers' compensation benefits
               (which, to the extent permitted by law, and if not deducted from the Player's
               Compensation by the Team, the Player hereby assigns to the Team) and any
               insurance provided for by the Team paid or payable to the Player by reason of
               said injury, until such time as the Player is fit to play skilled basketball, but not
               beyond the Season during which such termination occurred; and provided, further,
               (B) that if this Contract is terminated by the Team, in accordance with the
               provisions of this subparagraph, during the period from the January 10 of any
               Season through the end of such Season, the Player shall be entitled to receive his
               full Base Compensation for said Season; or
               (iv)     at any time, fail, refuse, or neglect to render his services hereunder or in
               any other manner materially breach this Contract.
        (b)    If this Contract is terminated by the Team by reason of the Player's failure to
render his services hereunder due to disability caused by an injury to the Player resulting directly
from his playing for the Team and rendering him unfit to play skilled basketball, and notice of
such injury is given by the Player as provided herein, the Player shall (subject to the provisions
set forth in Exhibit 3) be entitled to receive his full Base Compensation for the Season in which
the injury was sustained, less all workers' compensation benefits (which, to the extent permitted
by law, and if not deducted from the Player's Compensation by the Team, the Player hereby
                                                 A-assigns to the Team) and any insurance provided for by the Team paid or payable to the Player
by reason of said injury.
        (c)     Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 16(b) above, if this Contract is
terminated by the Team prior to the first game of a Regular Season by reason of the Player's
failure to render his services hereunder due to an injury or condition sustained or suffered during
a preceding Season, or after such Season but prior to the Player's participation in any basketball
practice or game played for the Team, payment by the Team of any Compensation earned
through the date of termination under paragraph 3(b) above, payment of the Player's board,
lodging, and expense allowance during the training camp period, payment of the reasonable
traveling expenses of the Player to his home city, and the expert training and coaching provided
by the Team to the Player during the training season shall be full payment to the Player.
        (d)     If this Contract is terminated by the Team during the period designated by the
Team for attendance at training camp, payment by the Team of any Compensation earned
through the date of termination under paragraph 3(b) above, payment of the Player's board,
lodging, and expense allowance during such period to the date of termination, payment of the
reasonable traveling expenses of the Player to his home city, and the expert training and
coaching provided by the Team to the Player during the training season shall be full payment to
the Player.
        (e)     If this Contract is terminated by the Team after the first game of a Regular
Season, except in the case provided for in subparagraphs (a)(iii) and (b) of this paragraph 16, the
Player shall be entitled to receive as full payment hereunder a sum of money which, when added
to the salary which he has already received during such Season, will represent the same
proportionate amount of the annual sum set forth in Exhibit 1 hereto as the number of days of
such Regular Season then past bears to the total number of days of such Regular Season, plus the
reasonable traveling expenses of the Player to his home.
        (f)     If the Team proposes to terminate this Contract in accordance with
subparagraph (a) of this paragraph 16, it must first comply with the following waiver procedure:
                (i)     The Team shall request the NBA Commissioner to request waivers from
                all other clubs. Such waiver request may not be withdrawn.
                (ii)    Upon receipt of the waiver request, any other team may claim assignment
                of this Contract at such waiver price as may be fixed by the League, the priority
                of claims to be determined in accordance with the NBA Constitution and By-
                Laws.
                (iii)   If this Contract is so claimed, the Team agrees that it shall, upon the
                assignment of this Contract to the claiming team, notify the Player of such
                assignment as provided in paragraph 10(c) hereof, and the Player agrees he shall
                report to the assignee team as provided in said paragraph 10(c).
                (iv)    If the Contract is not claimed prior to the expiration of the waiver period,
                it shall terminate and the Team shall promptly deliver written notice of
                termination to the Player.
                                                 A-(v)     The NBA shall promptly notify the Players Association of the disposition
                of any waiver request.
                (vi)    To the extent not inconsistent with the foregoing provisions of this
                subparagraph (f), the waiver procedures set forth in the NBA Constitution and
                By-Laws, a copy of which, as in effect on the date of this Contract, is attached
                hereto, shall govern.
        (g)     Upon any termination of this Contract by the Player, all obligations of the Team
to pay Compensation shall cease on the date of termination, except the obligation of the Team to
pay the Player's Compensation to said date.
        17.     DISPUTES.
        In the event of any dispute arising between the Player and the Team relating to any matter
arising under this Contract, or concerning the performance or interpretation thereof (except for a
dispute arising under paragraph 9 hereof), such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the
Grievance and Arbitration Procedure set forth in Article XXXI of the CBA.
        18.     PLAYER NOT A MEMBER.
        Nothing contained in this Contract or in any provision of the NBA Constitution and By-
Laws shall be construed to constitute the Player a member of the NBA or to confer upon him any
of the rights or privileges of a member thereof.
        19.     RELEASE.
        The Player hereby releases and waives any and all claims he may have, or that may arise
during the term of this Contract, against (a) the NBA and its related entities, the NBADL and its
related entities, and every member of the NBA or the NBADL, and every director, officer,
owner, stockholder, trustee, partner, and employee of the NBA, NBADL and their respective
related entities and/or any member of the NBA or NBADL and their related entities (excluding
persons employed as players by any such member), and (b) any person retained by the NBA
and/or the Players Association in connection with the NBA/NBPA Anti-Drug Program, the
Grievance Arbitrator, the System Arbitrator, and any other arbitrator or expert retained by the
NBA and/or the Players Association under the terms of the CBA, in both cases (a) and (b) above,
arising out of, or in connection with, and whether or not by negligence, (i) any injury that is
subject to the provisions of paragraph 7 hereof, (ii) any fighting or other form of violent and/or
unsportsmanlike conduct occurring during the course of any practice, any NBADL game, and/or
any NBA Exhibition, Regular Season, and/or Playoff game (in all cases on or adjacent to the
playing floor or in or adjacent to any facility used for such practices or games), (iii) the testing
procedures or the imposition of any penalties set forth in paragraph 8 hereof and in the
NBA/NBPA Anti-Drug Program, or (iv) any injury suffered in the course of his employment as
to which he has or would have a claim for workers' compensation benefits. The foregoing shall
not apply to any claim of medical malpractice against a Team-affiliated physician or other
medical personnel.
                                                A-20.     ENTIRE AGREEMENT.
        This Contract (including any Exhibits hereto) contains the entire agreement between the

entry into any new Player Contract, or (b) involving compensation or consideration of any kind
(including, without limitation, an investment or business opportunity) to be paid, furnished, or
made available to the Player, or any person or entity controlled by, related to, or acting with
authority on behalf of the Player, by the Team or any Team Affiliate.

                                          MISCONDUCT
        35.      The provisions of this Article 35 shall govern all Players in the Association,
hereinafter referred to as "Players."
        (a)      Each Member shall provide and require in every contract with any of its Players
that they shall be bound and governed by the provisions of this Article. Each Member, at the
direction of the Board of Governors or the Commissioner, as the case may be, shall take such
action as the Board or the Commissioner may direct in order to effectuate the purposes of this
Article.
        (b)      The Commissioner shall direct the dismissal and perpetual disqualification from
any further association with the Association or any of its Members, of any Player found by the
Commissioner after a hearing to have been guilty of offering, agreeing, conspiring, aiding or
attempting to cause any game of basketball to result otherwise than on its merits.
        (c)      If in the opinion of the Commissioner any act or conduct of a Player at or during
an Exhibition, Regular Season, or Playoff game has been prejudicial to or against the best
interests of the Association or the game of basketball, the Commissioner shall impose upon such
Player a fine not exceeding \$50,000, or may order for a time the suspension of any such Player
from any connection or duties with Exhibition, Regular Season, or Playoff games, or he may
order both such fine and suspension.
        (d)      The Commissioner shall have the power to suspend for a definite or indefinite
period, or to impose a fine not exceeding \$50,000, or inflict both such suspension and fine upon
any Player who, in his opinion, (i) shall have made or caused to be made any statement having,
or that was designed to have, an effect prejudicial or detrimental to the best interests of
basketball or of the Association or of a Member, or (ii) shall have been guilty of conduct that
does not conform to standards of morality or fair play, that does not comply at all times with all
federal, state, and local laws, or that is prejudicial or detrimental to the Association.
        (e)      Any Player who, directly or indirectly, entices, induces, persuades or attempts to
entice, induce, or persuade any Player, Coach, Trainer, General Manager or any other person
who is under contract to any other Member of the Association to enter into negotiations for or
relating to his services or negotiates or contracts for such services shall, on being charged with
such tampering, be given an opportunity to answer such charges after due notice and the
Commissioner shall have the power to decide whether or not the charges have been sustained; in
the event his decision is that the charges have been sustained, then the Commissioner shall have
the power to suspend such Player for a definite or indefinite period, or to impose a fine not
exceeding \$50,000, or inflict both such suspension and fine upon any such Player.
        (f)      Any Player who, directly or indirectly, wagers money or anything of value on the
outcome of any game played by a Team in the league operated by the Association shall, on being
charged with such wagering, be given an opportunity to answer such charges after due notice,
and the decision of the Commissioner shall be final, binding and conclusive and unappealable.
                                                  A-The penalty for such offense shall be within the absolute and sole discretion of the
Commissioner and may include a fine, suspension, expulsion and/or perpetual disqualification
from further association with the Association or any of its Members.
        (g)     Except for a penalty imposed under Paragraph (f) of this Article 35: (i) any
challenge by a Team to the decisions and acts of the Commissioner pursuant to Article 35 shall
be appealable to the Board of Governors, who shall determine such appeals in accordance with
such rules and regulations as may be adopted by the Board in its absolute and sole discretion, and
(ii) any challenge by a Player to the decisions or acts of the Commissioner pursuant to Article 35
shall be governed by the provisions of Article XXXI of the NBA/NBPA Collective Bargaining
Agreement then in effect.
                                                A-EXCERPT FROM NBA BY-LAWS
         5.01. Waiver Right. Except for sales and trading between Members in accordance with
these By-Laws, no Member shall sell, option, or otherwise assign the contract with, right to the
services of, or right to negotiate with, a Player without complying with the waiver procedure
prescribed by this Constitution and By-Laws.
         5.02.   Waiver Price. The waiver price shall be \$1,000 per Player.
         5.03. Waiver Procedure. A Member desiring to secure waivers on a Player shall notify
the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee, who shall, on behalf of such Member,
immediately notify all other Members of the waiver request. Such Player shall be assumed to
have been waived unless a Member shall notify the Commissioner or the Commissioner's
designee in accordance with Section 5.04 of a claim to the rights to such Player. Once a Member
has notified the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee of its desire to secure waivers on
a Player, such notice may not be withdrawn. A Player remains the financial responsibility of the
Member placing him on waivers until the waiver period set by the Commissioner or the
Commissioner's designee has expired.
         5.04. Waiver Period. If the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee distributes
notice of request for waiver at any time between August 15 and the end of the next Season, any
Members wishing to claim rights to the Player shall do so by giving notice by telephone and in a
Writing of such claim to the Commissioner or the Commissioner's designee within forty-
eight (48) hours after the time of such notice. If the Commissioner or the Commissioner's
designee distributes notice of request for waiver at any other time, any Member wishing to claim
rights to the Player shall do so by providing Written Notice of such claim to the Commissioner
or the Commissioner's designee within seven (7) days after the date of such notice. A Team may
not withdraw a claim to the rights to a Player on waivers.
         5.05.   Waiver Preferences.
         (a)     In the event that more than one (1) Member shall have claimed the rights to a
Player placed on waivers, the claiming Member with the lowest team standing at the time the
waiver was requested shall be entitled to acquire the rights to such Player. If the request for
waiver shall occur after the last day of the Season and before 11:59 p.m. eastern time on the
following November 30, the standings at the close of the previous Season shall govern.
         (b)     If the winning percentage of two (2) claiming Teams are the same, then the tie
shall be determined, if possible, on the basis of the Regular Season Games between the two (2)
Teams during the Season or during the preceding Season, as the case may be. If still tied, a toss
of a coin shall determine priority. For the purpose of determining standings, both Conferences of
the Association shall be deemed merged and a consolidated standing shall control.
         5.06. Players Acquired Through Waivers. A Member who has acquired the rights and
title to the contract of a Player through the waiver procedure may not sell or trade such rights for
a period of thirty (30) days after the acquisition thereof; provided, however, that if the rights to
                                                A-such Player were acquired between Seasons, the 30-day period described herein shall begin on
the first day of the next succeeding Season.
         5.07. Additional Waiver Rules. The Commissioner or the Board of Governors may
from time to time adopt additional rules (supplementary to those set forth in this Section 5) with
respect to the operation of the waiver procedure. Such rules shall not be inconsistent with the
provisions of this Section 5 and shall apply to but shall not be limited to the mechanics of notice,
inadvertent omission of notification to a Member, and rules of construction as to time.
                                               A-AGENT CERTIFICATION

 Player:
 Team:
 Date:
        Paragraph 7(b) is hereby deleted and the following shall be substituted in place and
instead thereof:
        "7.     (b) The Player agrees, notwithstanding any other provision of this Contract, that
he will to the best of his ability maintain himself in physical condition sufficient to play skilled
basketball at all times. If the Player, in the reasonable judgment of the physician designated for
that purpose by the Team, is not in good physical condition at the date of his first scheduled
game for the Team, or if, at the beginning of or during any Season, he fails to remain in good
physical condition, in either event so as to render the Player unfit in the reasonable judgment of
said physician to play skilled basketball, the Team shall have the right to suspend the Player for
successive one-week periods until the Player, in the reasonable judgment of the Team's
physician, is in good physical condition; provided, however, that at the end of each such one-
week period of suspension, if the Team notifies the Player, orally or in writing, that in its
reasonable judgment it believes the Player is still not in good physical condition, and if the
Player so requests, then the Player shall be examined by a physician or physicians designated for
such purpose by the President, or any Vice President if the President is not available, of the
American Society of Orthopedic Physicians, or equivalent organization (the "Reviewing
Physician"), whose sole judgment concerning the physical condition of the Player to play skilled
basketball shall be binding upon the Team and the Player for purposes of this paragraph. The
suspension of the Player shall be terminated promptly upon the failure of the Team to give the
Player the notice required at the end of the one-week period or upon the finding of said
Reviewing Physician that the Player is in physical condition sufficient to play skilled basketball.
In the event of a suspension permitted hereunder, the Compensation (excluding any signing
bonus or Incentive Compensation) payable to the Player for any Season during such suspension
shall be reduced in the same proportion as the length of the period of disability so determined
bears to the length of the Season. Nothing in this paragraph 7(b) shall authorize the Team to
suspend the Player solely because the Player is injured or ill."
