                              COLLECTION PROCEDURES
        When the player arrives at the collection site, the collector will ensure that the player is
positively identified through presentation of photo ID or identification by a team representative.
If the player's identity cannot be established, the collector shall not proceed with the collection.
        The player will be asked to select a sealed urine specimen cup. The player will then
provide his urine specimen under the direct observation of the collector.
        The collector shall ensure that the player has provided a urine specimen of sufficient
volume for accurate testing. If such a sample cannot immediately be provided by the player, he
shall be instructed to remain at the testing site for a reasonable period of time until he can
provide such a specimen. Once the specimen has been obtained, the player will select a sealed
specimen kit, which contains two bottles. The collector, in the presence of the player, will pour
the specimen into two bottles. One bottle will be used as the primary or "A" specimen and the
other will be used as the split or "B" specimen. The specimen bottles will be sealed with tamper-
proof seals in the presence of the player. The seals will contain a unique identification number
that corresponds to the number on the chain of custody form.
        The player and collector will complete the chain of custody form that documents the
handling of the specimen. The collector will note any irregularities concerning the specimen on
the chain of custody form. Both the player and collector will sign the chain of custody form.
The chain of custody form along with the two specimen bottles will be placed back into the kit.
The kit will be sealed and sent via overnight courier to the laboratory for testing.
                                                  I-Once the specimen arrives at the laboratory, the primary specimen will be analyzed. If
the primary specimen tests positive, the split sample will be placed in frozen storage and will be
available for testing by a different laboratory, if requested by the player.

                Re:     Confidentiality Agreement
Gentlemen:
                This will confirm the agreement of the National Basketball Players Association
("Players Association") (on behalf of itself and its employees, officers and outside advisors) to
maintain the confidentiality of all Confidential Information (as defined in Paragraph 6 below) in
connection with the audit, with respect to the 20__-20__ Salary Cap Year, of (i) the National
Basketball Association ("NBA") League Office, (ii) any NBA team that the parties agree is to be
included in such audit with respect to such Salary Cap Year (the "Team(s)"), and (iii) the
expenses incurred in connection with proceeds that come within Article VII, Section 1(a)(1)(viii)
of the Collective Bargaining Agreement ("CBA") entered into July ___, 2005, between the
Players Association and the NBA (collectively, the "Audit"). Capitalized terms not defined
herein shall have the meaning ascribed to such terms in the CBA.
                1.      The NBA and the Team(s) shall make available Confidential Information
for purposes of the Audit based on the representation of the Players Association that it (and its
employees, officers and outside advisors shall comply with the terms of this Confidentiality
Agreement at all times during and after the Audit. To that end, before any employee, officer or
outside advisor of the Players Association may be permitted to review any Confidential
Information, the Players Association shall require such employee, officer or outside advisor to
agree, in writing (in the form of acknowledgment annexed hereto), to comply with the terms of
this Confidentiality Agreement, and the Players Association shall promptly provide copies
thereof to the NBA.
                2.      The Players Association shall maintain the absolute confidentiality of all
Confidential Information at all times and shall not disclose to any person or entity, except as
permitted herein, any Confidential Information. The Players Association agrees that it may use
or refer to Confidential Information only during the course of the Audit and solely for the
purpose of conducting the Audit in accordance with the terms and conditions of the CBA and
this Confidentiality Agreement, and that Confidential Information may not be used or referred to
by the Players Association (or any of its employees, officers and outside advisors), at any time,
                                                J-for any purpose other than to conduct the Audit in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the CBA and this Confidentiality Agreement. The Players Association (and its employees,
officers, NBA team player representatives ("Player Representatives") and outside advisors) shall
not disclose, disseminate or provide any Confidential Information to any other person or entity
(including NBA players who are not officers of, or Player Representatives for, the Players
Association and any representative of any player), at any time, for any purpose; provided,
however, that the Players Association may only disclose, disseminate or provide a summary of
Confidential Information to Player Representatives in aggregate form without identifying any
specific information (e.g., by sponsor). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Confidentiality Agreement, the Players Association shall not be deemed to have violated any
provision herein if the Players Association discloses to such third party that the Audit is being
undertaken and that the Players Association is subject to a confidentiality agreement and,
therefore, not permitted to discuss the Audit. The foregoing shall not foreclose the Players
Association from disclosing Confidential Information during the course of a proceeding before
the System Arbitrator, an appeal to the Appeals Panel of an award of the System Arbitrator and a
judicial action to enforce any such proceeding or award.
                3.      The Players Association shall adopt and implement such procedures to
insure the confidentiality of Confidential Information as would be employed by a reasonable and
prudent person to safeguard the confidentiality of his or her own most confidential information,
or, if more stringent, such procedures as are employed for such purposes by the Players
Association. Such procedures shall include, but not be limited to, steps to insure that such
Confidential Information is disclosed only to those Players Association employees and officers
and, subject to the restrictions set forth in Paragraph 2 above, Player Representatives who have a
need to have access to such Confidential Information and only for the purpose of conducting the
Audit in accordance with the terms of the CBA and this Confidentiality Agreement. The
foregoing shall not foreclose the Players Association from disclosing Confidential Information
during the course of a proceeding before the System Arbitrator, an appeal to the Appeals Panel
of an award of the System Arbitrator and a judicial action to enforce any such proceeding or
award.
                4.      The Players Association agrees that no copies of Confidential Information
made available by the NBA and the Team(s) may be removed from the NBA's or the Team(s)'
offices (as applicable).
                5.      If the Players Association is required by governmental or judicial
authorities (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents, subpoena,
civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any Confidential Information, it shall
provide the NBA and/or the Team(s) with prompt notice so that the NBA and/or the Team(s)
may seek an appropriate protective order. If, in the absence of a protective order, the Players
Association is, after giving notice in accordance with the preceding sentence, compelled to
disclose Confidential Information or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or
penalty, the Players Association may disclose only such Confidential Information as is necessary
to avoid such liability without incurring liability hereunder.
                                                  J-6.     For purposes of this Confidentiality Agreement, "Confidential
Information" shall mean all documents, materials and other information reviewed or made
available (whether in written or oral form) in connection with the Audit (including, without
limitation, all documents, materials and other information made available by
PricewaterhouseCoopers, LLP), and shall include all excerpts, extracts, summaries and contents
thereof and notes taken during the Audit; provided, however that Confidential Information shall
not include information that (a) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a
result of disclosure by the Players Association (including Players Association affiliates or
representatives), (b) was available to the Players Association prior to its disclosure by the NBA
or the Team(s) (as applicable), or (c) becomes available to the Players Association from a source
other than the NBA or the Team(s), provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality
agreement with the NBA, the Team(s) or the Players Association.
                7.     The Players Association acknowledges that the terms and conditions
contained in this Confidentiality Agreement are reasonable and necessary to protect the
legitimate interests of the NBA and the Team(s), do not cause the Players Association undue
hardship, and that any violation of the provisions of this Confidentiality Agreement or disclosure
of any Confidential Information without the NBA's or the Team(s)' (as applicable) prior written
consent will result in irreparable injury to the NBA and/or the Team(s) for which there is no
adequate remedy. Accordingly, in the event of any such violation or disclosure, the NBA and/or
the Team(s) shall be entitled to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief from any federal or
state court of competent jurisdiction located in New York, New York, and the Players
Association hereby consents to, and waives any objection to, venue and jurisdiction in such
courts. In addition, the Players Association shall indemnify and hold harmless the NBA and its
members teams and their respective affiliates, owners, directors, governors, officers and
employees, and the successors, assigns and personal representatives of the foregoing parties
("NBA indemnified parties"), from and against all liability, damages and costs (including
attorneys fees) arising out of any claim asserted against any NBA indemnified party relating to
any use or disclosure of Confidential Information by, or the violation of this Confidentiality
Agreement by, the Players Association (or any of its employees, officers, Player Representatives
and outside advisors), provided that: (a) the Players Association is given prompt notice of any
such claim, (b) has the right to approve counsel and/or has the opportunity to undertake the
defense of such claim and (c) the indemnified party does not admit liability with respect to and
does not settle such claim without the prior written consent of the Players Association. The
Players Association also agrees that the relief provided for in this Paragraph 7 shall be
cumulative and in addition to any other rights or remedies to which the NBA and the Team(s)
may be entitled.
                8.     This Confidentiality Agreement is the final and complete agreement
between the parties with respect to its subject matter. Any waiver of or modification to this
Confidentiality Agreement must be in a writing and signed by each party. Any waiver in any
particular instance of the rights and limitations contained herein shall not be deemed and is not
intended to be a general waiver of any rights or limitations contained herein and shall not operate
as a waiver beyond the particular instance.
                                                J-9.      This Confidentiality Agreement shall be governed by and construed and
enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to the
principles of conflicts of law thereof.
                If the foregoing coincides with your understanding of our agreement, please sign
the enclosed copy of this letter and return it to me.
                                        Sincerely,
